# Step 2: Creating the Flask App

**Series:** DevOps for Lazy People  

## What This Covers

Creating a simple Flask web application that mimics a streaming service interface (like Netflix). It's a single-file Python app with embedded HTML/CSS - perfect for learning DevOps without getting lost in complex application code.

## What is Flask?

Flask is a lightweight Python web framework. You write Python code that handles routes (URLs), and Flask serves web pages to browsers. It's minimal - no bloat, just what you need to get a web app running.
